# go-chat-with-fuse

This is a simple chat app written in Go. Each chat has a fuse that counts down. If the fuse runs out, the chat closes and deletes itself. Writing a message to the chat resets the fuse.

This was done to play around with Go, Server-sent Events and HTMX.

A live demo can be found here: soon..
