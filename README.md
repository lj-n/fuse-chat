# fuse-chat

This is a simple chat app written in Go. Each chat has a <i>fuse</i> that counts down. If the <i>fuse</i> runs out, the chat closes and deletes itself. Writing a message to the chat resets the <i>fuse</i>.

A Demo can be [found here](https://fuse-chat.linusthe.dev).

The used css theme is [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css).
